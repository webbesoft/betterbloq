First of all, what is a purchase cycle.

A purchase cycle is a period during which users can make orders and those orders will be grouped into a single bulk order.

Purchase Cycle Management (by Platform Admin)

## Purchase Cycle Creation:

1. Creating a PurchaseCycle requires:

- name (the name of the purchase cycle)
- starts_at (when it starts)
- ends_at (when it ends)
- status (e.g., upcoming (if creating for the future,) or active).

**Only one purchase cycle can be active at any given time**
